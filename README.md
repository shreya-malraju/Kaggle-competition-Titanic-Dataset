The competition is all about creating a simple model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic which was very shocking and one of the biggest disasters in the world which happened in April, 1912.

The total data is split into 
1. train.csv
2. test.csv
The train.csv is used for training the ML Models, which is based on features like a specific passenger's Age, Gender, Class, etc.

The test.csv is used to check the performance of the model for the new/unseen data.

The Jupyter Notebook where the model is implemented can be found above.
